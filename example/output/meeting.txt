[00:00 - 00:20] Speaker D: Do you know why I've called this meeting sales figures for Regional down to address as soon as we can so I'd like to start by asking Maya to talk us through ok, and then we can take a look at the products for offering and compare them with the competition over to you to
[00:20 - 00:44] Speaker A: show you how the figures are looking if you look at sales year-to-date in order to meet budget this year. We will my opinion have to start some cost-saving measures. What do you mean by that redundancies? That's one possibility.
[00:44 - 00:47] Speaker C: I can't agree with you there. We need a strong workforce.
[00:47 - 01:02] Speaker D: Ok? Thanks. Maya look cost-cutting is something that we need to think about but we also need to stop the downturn in sales and regain market share so can I bring you in? Any common it's
[01:02 - 01:08] Speaker B: hard to know what the problem is our products are competitive so
[01:08 - 01:14] Speaker D: they're not getting better offers from the competition. I don't think so,
[01:14 - 01:19] Speaker B: how about I talk to you through our office at the moment. I prepared some handouts.
[01:19 - 01:34] Speaker D: Yes, go ahead. It would be good to look at the details. Ok? Thanks. David Edwards all useful information so I can return to you now. Do you have any ideas? Why this downturn is happening?
[01:34 - 01:44] Speaker C: It's true. We are seeing decreasing custom in our region. There's also been an increase in customers cancelling your contract within 14-days,
[01:44 - 01:54] Speaker B: so do you know what do the customers so why they don't like our offers I personally feel but this is vital information. I mean
[01:54 - 02:08] Speaker C: what I was saying. I'd like to suggest we review our customer account. First Contact to after-sales care with that and see if the sales figures improve,
[02:08 - 02:12] Speaker D: what do you think of that?
[02:12 - 02:21] Speaker A: Can I make another suggestion? I think we need to see the whole picture from the customers point of view a customer survey perhaps
[02:21 - 02:28] Speaker C: that won't be a big project it would need a project team which means taking stuff from other departments actually
[02:28 - 02:38] Speaker A: I was thinking about hiring an external researcher get a neutral view on our position in the markets and customers use us like
[02:38 - 02:41] Speaker D: that idea be very useful information which
[02:41 - 02:43] Speaker C: department pays for it, so we
[02:43 - 02:51] Speaker D: can talk about that in a minute. Do you agree in principle though that we need to understand the cause of the problem
[02:53 - 03:01] Speaker D: could you look for a market research company? We could work for them. That's great. Well, it's environment
