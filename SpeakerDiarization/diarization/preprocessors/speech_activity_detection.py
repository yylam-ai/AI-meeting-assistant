class RemoveNonSpeech:
    """Remove (precomputed) non-speech regions from annotation

    This is useful for speaker verification databases where files contain only
    one speaker but actual speech regions are not annotated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sad_rttm : Path
        Path to RTTM file containing speech activity detection result.

    Usage
    -----
    1. Prepare a file containing speech activity detection results in RTTM
       format (here /path/to/sad.rttm)
    2. Add a "preprocessors" section in your "config.yml" configuration file
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        preprocessors:
            annotation:
                name: pyannote.audio.preprocessors.RemoveNonSpeech
                params:
                    sad_rttm: /path/to/sad.rttm
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
    3. Enjoy your updated "annotation" key (where non-speech regions are
       removed).
