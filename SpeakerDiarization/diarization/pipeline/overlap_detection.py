    Parameters
    ----------
    scores : Wrappable, optional
        Describes how raw overlapped speech detection scores should be obtained.
        See pyannote.audio.features.wrapper.Wrapper documentation for details.
        Defaults to "@ovl_scores" that indicates that protocol files provide
        the scores in the "ovl_scores" key.
    precision : `float`, optional
        Target detection precision. Defaults to 0.9.
    fscore : bool, optional
        Optimize (precision/recall) fscore. Defaults to optimizing recall at
        target precision.


    Hyper-parameters
    ----------------
    onset, offset : `float`
        Onset/offset detection thresholds
    min_duration_on, min_duration_off : `float`
        Minimum duration in either state (overlap or not)
