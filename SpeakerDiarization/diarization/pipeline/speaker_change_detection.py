    Parameters
    ----------
    scores : Wrappable, optional
        Describes how raw speaker change detection scores should be obtained.
        See pyannote.audio.features.wrapper.Wrapper documentation for details.
        Defaults to "@scd_scores" that indicates that protocol files provide
        the scores in the "scd_scores" key.
    purity : `float`, optional
        Target segments purity. Defaults to 0.95.
    fscore : bool, optional
        Optimize (precision/recall) fscore. Defaults to optimizing coverage at
        given target `purity`.
    diarization : bool, optional
        Use diarization purity and coverage. Defaults to segmentation purity
        and coverage.

    Hyper-parameters
    ----------------
    alpha : `float`
        Peak detection threshold.
    min_duration : `float`
        Segment minimum duration.
