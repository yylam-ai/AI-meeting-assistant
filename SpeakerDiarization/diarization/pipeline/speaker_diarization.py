    Parameters
    ----------
    sad_scores : Text or Path or 'oracle', optional
        Describes how raw speech activity detection scores
        should be obtained. It can be either the name of a torch.hub model, or
        the path to the output of the validation step of a model trained
        locally, or the path to scores precomputed on disk.
        Defaults to "@sad_scores", indicating that protocol
        files provide the scores in the corresponding "sad_scores" key.
        Use 'oracle' to assume perfect speech activity detection.
    scd_scores : Text or Path or 'oracle', optional
        Describes how raw speaker change detection scores
        should be obtained. It can be either the name of a torch.hub model, or
        the path to the output of the validation step of a model trained
        locally, or the path to scores precomputed on disk.
        Defaults to "@scd_scores", indicating that protocol
        files provide the scores in the corresponding "scd_scores" key.
        Use 'oracle' to assume perfect speech turn segmentation,
        `sad_scores` should then be set to 'oracle' too.
    embedding : Text or Path, optional
        Describes how raw speaker embeddings should be obtained. It can be
        either the name of a torch.hub model, or the path to the output of the
        validation step of a model trained locally, or the path to embeddings
        precomputed on disk. Defaults to "@emb" that indicates that protocol
        files provide the embeddings in the "emb" key.
    metric : {'euclidean', 'cosine', 'angular'}, optional
        Metric used for comparing embeddings. Defaults to 'cosine'.
    method : {'pool', 'affinity_propagation'}
        Clustering method. Defaults to 'pool'.
    evaluation_only : `bool`
        Only process the evaluated regions. Default to False.
    purity : `float`, optional
        Optimize coverage for target purity.
        Defaults to optimizing diarization error rate.

    Hyper-parameters
    ----------------
    min_duration : `float`
        Do not cluster speech turns shorter than `min_duration`. Assign them to
        the closest cluster (of long speech turns) instead.
