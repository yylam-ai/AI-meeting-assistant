    TODO explain

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration, in seconds. Defaults to 1.
    min_duration : float, optional
        When provided, use chunks of random duration between `min_duration` and
        `duration` for training. Defaults to using fixed duration chunks.
    per_turn : int, optional
        Number of chunks per speech turn. Defaults to 1.
        If per_turn is greater than one, embeddings of the same speech turn
        are averaged before comparison. The intuition is that it might help
        learn embeddings meant to be averaged/summed.
    per_label : `int`, optional
        Number of sequences per speaker in each batch. Defaults to 1.
    per_fold : `int`, optional
        Number of different speakers per batch. Defaults to 32.
    per_epoch : `float`, optional
        Force total audio duration per epoch, in days.
        Defaults to total duration of protocol subset.
    label_min_duration : `float`, optional
        Remove speakers with less than that many seconds of speech.
        Defaults to 0 (i.e. keep them all).
    metric : {'euclidean', 'cosine', 'angular'}, optional
        Defaults to 'cosine'.
    margin: float, optional
        Margin multiplicative factor. Defaults to 0.2.
